                    Hello! My name is <b>Kleio</b> - that's how the Greek authorities decided to spell the English version of my name, so I'm stuck with it. It's pronounced Clio. I was named after my grandmother, who was named after the Muse of History, one of the nine Muses in Greek mythology. As you've probably guessed by now, I'm from Greece. :) I've been in the UK since 2013, currently living in the North East. I'm a graphic designer by trade and a photographer by <del>stubbornness</del> passion. Having been sort of "forced" into coding due to the nature of my job, I got fascinated pretty quickly and have been trying to increase my knowledge and skills in any way I can. Being self-taught has left me with some knowledge gaps and without the invaluable input of a tutor and the different perspectives of like-minded peers. I hope this class will give me confidence in my coding skills, and some much-needed feedback and criticism, as these are the cornerstones for growth.
                </p>
